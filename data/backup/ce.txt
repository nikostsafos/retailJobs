The following is a definition of:  EMPLOYMENT, HOURS, AND EARNINGS--NATIONAL (CE)

Survey Description:  The Current Employment Statistics Program provides 
employment, paid hours, and earnings information on a national basis in 
considerable industrial detail.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data 
each month from a sample of establishments in all nonfarm activities including 
government.

The data include series for total employment; number of women employees; number of 
production or nonsupervisory employees; and for both all employees and for 
production and nonsupervisory employees, average hourly earnings, average weekly 
hours, average weekly earnings, and average weekly overtime hours.  Overtime hours
are produced for manufacturing industries only.

A sample of approximately 145,000 businesses and government agencies representing
approximately 557,000 worksites throughout the United States is utilized for this 
monthly survey.  For hours and earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers 
in private, nonagricultural industries, the sample contains about 270,000 employer 
units.

All employment, hours and earnings series are classified according to the 
2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The industry 
code used in the survey corresponds to the NAICS code, except in those cases 
where more than one NAICS has been combined.

Summary of Data Available:  For all employees, women, and production or 
nonsupervisory employees, over 4,400 published monthly employment series are 
available.  The series for all employees include more than 900 industries seasonally
adjusted and over 900 not seasonally adjusted at various levels of aggregation.

About 6,800 series are published each month for average weekly earnings, average
hourly earnings, average weekly hours, and, in manufacturing, average weekly 
overtime hours.

Hours and earnings data are available for about 600 industries.

Over 5300 special derivative series such as indexes and constant dollar series are 
also available.


Most employment series begin in 1990, although some are available from 1939
to the present.

Employment by major industry sector is available from 1939.


Frequency of Observations:  Data series are monthly in almost all cases; quarterly 
averages are available for total employment, average weekly hours, and average 
overtime hours, seasonally adjusted (datatypes 19, 20, 25, 36, and 37).

Annual Averages:  Annual averages are available for all series, which are not 
adjusted for seasonality.

Data Characteristics:  Earnings are measured in dollars and are stored with 
two decimal places.  Average weekly and overtime hours are measured in hours 
and are stored with one decimal place.

Employment is measured in thousands of workers and is stored with one 
decimal place for three-digit NAICS and lower-level industries; other employment 
data are stored with no decimal place.

Special characteristics of the data are footnoted where necessary.
New Footnote  I indicates that the seasonally adjusted series is independently seasonally
adjusted and is not used in aggregating to higher summary industries.  For all employees,
higher summary series, such as total nonfarm, are aggregated for the 3-digit NAICS level.


Updating Schedule:  Updates are usually available on the third Friday 
following the reporting week (week containing the 12th) in the reference 
month.  These updates contain first estimates for the reference month, second 
estimates for the month preceding the reference month, and third estimates for 
the month two months prior to the reference month.

Each year with the release of January estimates in February, CES data are re-
anchored to universe counts of nonfarm employment or benchmarks for the most recent 
March. All not seasonally adjusted series are subject to revision back to the prior 
year’s benchmarked data (21 months of data), while 5 years of seasonally adjusted 
estimates may be revised.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define 
ce.series.  Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated 
by spaces; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character.

the data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character.  

The ce.data file is partitioned into a number of separate files:  See Section 2
