# Are Retail Jobs Disappearing?

Web version: https://nikostsafos.github.io/retailJobs/

Retail employment is in trouble: in February and March 2017, employment declined by 56,000. An Axios article greeted the news with dismay, noting that "retail workers are being displaced in droves." The Economist remarked that retailers is "a giant established industry ... descending into crisis." Edward Luce of the Financial Times was more blunt: "America faces a retail crunch as big as the manufacturing crisis of the last generation." Is that so? What is happening?
